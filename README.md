# VISIT-TOR BASH SCRIPT

### This script connect to Tor (with Tor Browser and visit any pages you want automatically...)

**Description**

Program NEEDS you have executed a sudo command before, but you can't run it directly with sudo because Tor Browser doesn't accept a root-user.

Program open Tor Browser automatically to a page specified inside code: you can choose a list of page to be visited randomly...

After a few seconds program close Tor and change mac address (that's the reason it's necessary to run sudo before...) -> this feature needs you've installed macchanger program before

This script repeats these procedure for N times -> you can choose how many times pass a number as parameter on program launching or will be executed for a default number of time (15 usually)
